# Contributing

Contributions make the open-source community a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.

The development branch is `main`. This is the branch that all pull requests should be made against.

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- Reproducible. Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- Specific. Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- Unique. Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- Scoped to a Single Bug. One bug per report.
